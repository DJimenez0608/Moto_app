Nomenclature rules for Flutter projects:

- File names: Use snake_case (e.g., home_page.dart).
- Class names: Use UpperCamelCase (e.g., MyHomePage).
- Variable and field names: Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., counterValue).
- Constant names: Use lowerCamelCase or use ALL_UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES for global constants if appropriate.
- Widget names: Use UpperCamelCase and end with Widget or their function (e.g., CustomButton, UserAvatar).
- Method and function names: Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., fetchData()).
- Private members: Use lowerCamelCase with leading underscore (e.g., _myValue).
- Enum names: Use UpperCamelCase for enum type and values (e.g., StatusType.success).
- Package and directory names: Use snake_case and short, meaningful names (e.g., widgets, models).
- Avoid abbreviations except for very common ones (e.g., "btn" for button is discouraged; use "Button" instead).
- Use descriptive, clear, and concise names. Names should reflect the purpose or function.
- Do not prefix files, classes, or variables with redundant words (e.g., prefer user_profile.dart over my_user_profile.dart).

These conventions ensure clarity, consistency, and easy navigation in Flutter codebases.
